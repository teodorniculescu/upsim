#0 Improve coding style - DONE
Set PyCharm line indent to 80.
Format all files in order to satisfy this criteria.

#1 Switch .result to CSV format - DONE
Change the way .result files are represented to a CSV style.

#2 Generate tables from .result files - TODO
Use a python library to generate a table from the .csv results, similar to how
SQL databases do it.

#3 Start SYNTAX description in README file - TODO
Define syntactically correct inputs in README.

#4 Errors for incorrect inputs - TODO
Create / Modify a wrapper in order to raise Exceptions if incorrect inputs are
inserted.

#5 Tests for incorrect inputs - TODO
Create tests that

#6 Compare .result files to .answer files - TODO
Each result will be compare to an .answer file which contains the result which
is expected to be the correct one. If the files differ, then it means that
something is not correct in the code (either newly added code somehow breaks old
code results or something else happened)

#7 Add all possible logic gates simple logic gates - TODO
Add 1 input and 1 output (1I1O) logic gate: NOT
Add 2 input and 1 output (2I1O) logic gates: AND / OR / NAND / NOR / XOR / XNOR
Create tests for these logic gates.

#8 Logic gates with indefinite amounts of inputs - TODO
Create and test simple logic gates that can take as many inputs as possible
without hard coding the number of inputs.
n input 1 output logic gates - AND / OR / etc same as in #7

#9 Combinational logic circuits - TODO
Implement and test multiplexers and adders (half and full).
1st implementation: without logic gates - with code
2nd implementation: with logic gates - the module is created not by code which
is executed in the calc function but by executing individual logic gates which
are inside the module

#10 Sequential logic circuits - TODO
Implement and test SR Latch and JK Bistable
same as in #9, with and without logic gates

#11 Implement configurable logic block - TODO
Implement and test a CLB

#12 RUN syntax toggle each step - TODO
Specify in the RUN command syntax if you either want to see each step in the
simulation which includes the SSN steps or only the main steps when the output
is determined.
