# Microprocessor Simulator - Î¼psim

This project simulates digital circuits. The logic is specified by the user and the program generates the truth table and graphical simulation. 

You write logic in a test file and specify the path in the MicroprocessorSimulator.py file. You can find examples in the unit_test folder.

Graphical simulation of the /unit_test/final/version8 test. This is a simulation of the simple as possible computer (SAP) from the book Digital Computer Electronics by Albert Paul Malvino. This is inspired by the [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0N5baNlQWJCUrhCEo8WlA) youtube playlist of building an 8-bit computer.
